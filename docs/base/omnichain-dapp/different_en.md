# Differences Between Full-Chain Applications and Single or Multi-Chain Applications

There are hundreds of blockchains worldwide, and this number continues to grow with the development of the industry. Each blockchain is isolated, which can pose a dilemma for developers when deciding on which blockchain to deploy their applications. Deploying smart contracts on multiple chains separately increases the workload for developers and creates difficulties for users of decentralized applications in conducting cross-chain operations.

## What is a Single-Chain Application?
A single-chain application involves deploying smart contracts on a single blockchain. Developers commonly choose a well-considered blockchain for initial deployment. However, this approach often misses the opportunity for users on other blockchains to participate in the application. With the MAP Protocol option, the need to make a single-chain decision from the outset becomes unnecessary.

## What is a Multi-Chain Application?
Multi-chain applications refer to the deployment of smart contracts on different blockchains. As projects grow and attract more users, developers need to consider user convenience and how to attract participation from users on uncovered blockchains. However, deploying contracts separately, apart from complex development, leads to isolated blockchains where users cannot interact within the same application. This poor user experience can ultimately lead to user attrition to competitors.

## What is a Full-Chain Application?
A full-chain application represents an entirely different development paradigm. Developers only need to use the MAP Protocol as a development tool. They can automatically cover all major blockchains through MAP Protocol's infrastructure and related developer tools, ensuring interoperability. Users remain agnostic to the underlying blockchains. This approach bypasses the development stage from single-chain applications to multi-chain applications, allowing developers to achieve a one-time comprehensive solution in terms of infrastructure.
