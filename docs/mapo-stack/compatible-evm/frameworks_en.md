## introduction-to-frameworks

Building a complete decentralized application requires different technologies. Software frameworks include many of the features you need, or provide a simple plug-in system to select the tools you need.
The following `MAPO-Relay-Chain` is collectively referred to as MAPO.


These frameworks come with many unconventional features, such as:

- Program a local blockchain function.
- Utilities for editing and testing your smart contracts.
- Developing custom features for clients, building your client-facing application in the same project and repository..
- Whether it's a locally running instance or using one of the public networks, you can connect to the blockchain network and configure contract deployment.
- Decentralized application distribution is integrated with storage options similar to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a distributed system used for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data.
