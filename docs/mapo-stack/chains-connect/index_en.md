Interoperability between different blockchain networks refers to the transfer of data and assets to enable collaboration and interaction for decentralized applications. Mapo Protocol, with its unique three-layer architecture consisting of the `application layer`, `Mos layer`, and `protocol layer`, provides a convenient way for third-party chains and dApp developers to connect. Using the standardized modules provided by Mapo Protocol, third-party chains only need to implement their own light clients (Solidity version) based on their consensus mechanisms and deploy a light client for `mapo-relay-chain` to easily achieve cross-chain communication with `mapo-relay-chain`.

Mapo Protocol supports connecting both `EVM-compatible` and `non-EVM-compatible` chains and also supports full-chain dApp development:
